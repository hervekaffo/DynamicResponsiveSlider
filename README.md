# DynamicResponsiveSlider
Dynamic Image slider where you can just add a folder and a sub folder with your images and it will create a gallery

you can add a galery just by copy and paste your folder containing a subfolder of images into the galeries folder and it will be dynamically loaded as a responsive lider with touch swiping capability.   the tile will be you subfolder name and the subtitle will your folder name.  I tested it with the folder CARS/AUTOMATIC CAR SLIDER.
